# 🌀 RippleTrade

Milestone-triggered smart contracts for secure cross-border payments in emerging markets.

---

## ✨ TL;DR

RippleTrade solves late and risky international payments for SME exporters in Asia and LATAM. Using stablecoin-based escrow with smart milestone triggers, we remove the need for exporters to chase payments or rely solely on buyer goodwill.

This is especially relevant for real-world personas like:

- 🪑 A Javanese furniture exporter shipping custom pieces to Europe, often paid late or only partially.  
- 🔥 A coconut charcoal producer from Borneo exporting to the Middle East, struggling with buyer trust and upfront cost recovery.

---

## 📦 Problem

SME exporters often face:

- Delayed or partial payments  
- High fees and FX risks  
- Zero milestone accountability  
- Low trust from first-time overseas buyers

The result: poor cash flow and limited growth. The $1.2T SME trade finance gap grows 10% annually, and Indonesia is one of the hardest hit.

## 👥 Target Users

| User | Needs |
|------|-------|

## 🔁 Core User Flow

1. Exporter creates contract draft with buyer address, stablecoin, total value, milestone breakdown, and dispute timeout.  
2. Importer reviews and funds the contract in stablecoin.  
3. Exporter triggers milestone with proof (e.g., BL scan).  
4. Importer confirms milestone or disputes.  
5. If no response, smart contract auto-releases payment after timeout.  
6. Process repeats until full delivery and final payment.  
7. Exporter off-ramps to local fiat via third-party provider.

## 🧾 Trade Terms Supported

RippleTrade simulates:

- **D/P (Documents against Payment)**: Funds released after proof of shipment.  
- **D/A (Documents against Acceptance)**: Timed fallback releases if importer takes no action.
